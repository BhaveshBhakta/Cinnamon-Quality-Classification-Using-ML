## üåø Cinnamon Quality Classification

### üìå Project Overview

This project aims to classify cinnamon samples into quality labels‚Äî**High**, **Medium**, or **Low**‚Äîbased on their chemical composition. Using a balanced dataset and various classification models, this solution provides an automated way to determine cinnamon quality that could be applied in food safety, quality control, or agricultural research.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Highlights

* **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Cinnamon Quality Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madaraweerasingha/cinnamon-quality-classification)
* **Size**: 60 samples with 7 chemical attributes + 1 label
* **Key Features**:

  * Moisture, Ash, Volatile Oil, Chromium, Coumarin, and others
* **Approach**:

  * Data exploration and visualization (histograms, boxplots, heatmaps)
  * Label encoding, standardization
  * Classification models: Logistic Regression, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.
* **Best Accuracy**: 100% for most models including XGBoost, SVM, and Random Forest
